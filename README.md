# Personal_Finance_Agent

This project develops an autonomous AI agent system that analyzes personal financial data to identify anomalies, forecast spending, and provide actionable financial recommendations. The system uses a multi-agent architecture with structured communication, domain heuristics, and LLM-assisted reasoning to deliver explainable financial insights.
